		<h1>Some thoughts on Building Brime (A CSS framework)</h1>

		<p class="padding-small">Building a CSS framework was a really interesting task for me to take on. I'd never built a framework before, and especically not one that was supposed to IE7 compatible. There was a small learning curve, but I grasped relatively quickly what I needed to do.</p>

	<div class="col-4 padding-small">

			<p>
				Step 1: Learn
			</p>
		</h3>
		<p class="padding-small">I didn't know how exactly I could accomplish this, so I Googled and read a lot about building a grid based framework. I also tried a few frameworks, read through documentation of others, and thought about the overall syntax and purpose of my framework. I knew that it wouldn't be perfect, but it would be a good learning experience, and I would get the chance to be able to build something useful from scratch.</p>

	<div class="col-4 padding-small">
		<h3 class="padding-small">
			<p>
				Step 2: Build
			</p>
		</h3>
		<p class="padding-small">Next, I actually dove into the code. I built, I tested, I iterated. It was a lot of fun, and I had to Google A LOT. Testing on a IE7 browser broke ALL my code, and it took a lot of figuring out, and Stack Overflow to figure out how the browser reads the code. Finally, I came across something that really helped me.</p>

		<p class="padding-small">I found this snippet of code.
		</p>

		<code>
			 <p class="padding-small">.col-1, .col-2, .col-3, .col-4, .col-5, .col-6, .col-7, .col-8, .col-9, .col-10, .col-11, .col-12  {</p>
			<br>
			    <p class="padding-medium">*display: inline; /* this entire section will only be read by ie7 and is a workaround for inline-block*/</p>
			    <p class="padding-medium">*zoom: 1;</p>
			    <p class="padding-medium">*box-sizing: border-box;</p>
			<p class="padding-small">}</p>
		</code>
		<p class="padding-small">This helped me make the grid system, backwards compatible.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="padding-small col-4">
		<h3 class="padding-small">
			<p>
				Step 3: Future
			</p>
		</h3>
		<p class="padding-small">In the future, I want to style inputs, and buttons. I want to build out and make this a proper framework, something along the lines of Bulma or Bootstrap. It's gonna be a lot of work, but I think that I can definitely put some work into this, and build a good framework.</p>
