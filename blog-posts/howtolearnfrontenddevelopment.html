		<h1>How to Learn Front End Development</h1>

		<p class="padding-small">It can be really difficult to start learning anything. Even front end development. It's difficult to know where to start, and what resources will work the best.</p>
		<p class="padding-small">I compiled a list of resources that worked best for me. If I was starting out in front end development, this is what I would do in order to learn quickly and effectively.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-4 padding-small">
		<h3>
			<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Step 1: HTML/CSS - Codecademy</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="padding-small">Codecademy is great for learning syntax. I would start learning HTML/CSS from Codecademy. It's the best place to wrap your head around what is going on, and begin to understand how things work.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-4 padding-small">
		<h3>
			<a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" target="_blank">Step 2: HTML/CSS - Shay Howe</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="padding-small">Shay Howe has the best guide on learning HTML/CSS. It goes into depth about HTML/CSS and guides you through learning very well. After I finished this guide, I finally had a good grasp on HTML/CSS, and it gave me the tools to begin building things on my own.</p>
	</div>	
	<div class="col-4 padding-small">
		<h3>
			<a href="http://learnhowtoprogram.com/" target="_blank">Step 3: Basic Front End - Learnhowtoprogram.com</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="padding-small">Learnhowtoprogram.com is the top website I recommend to people learning how to program. It will teach you how to use Git, use HTML/CSS and introduce you to Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework. It will then move onto building projects with jQuery, and teach you Object Oriented JavaScript.</p>
		<p class="padding-small">But I think the best part of Learnhowtoprogram.com, is that it is extremely well structured, unlike a lot of tutorials you will take. It assigns you to complete tasks over one month, and has alloted assignments per day.</p>
	</div>
	<div  class="col-4 padding-small">
		<h3>
			<a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">Step 4: JavaScript - JavaScript30</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="padding-small"><strong>Warning: This is the only website I will recommend, that I have not personally used.</strong> But, I have bought and dove into other courses that this author has offered. He has great resources, and this seems like a GREAT way to learn and improve JavaScript. I have done something like this, by myself (Can be viewed <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/DPorwo/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
		<p class="padding-small">Basically, this is your chance to build. And you should build stuff. You have enough knowledge to dive into projects, and learn as much as you can about JavaScript. So dive into JavaScript, and learn as much as you can.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-4 padding-small">
		<h3>
			<a href="https://udacity.com/" target="_blank">Step 5: Front End - Udacity</a>
		</h3>
		<p class="padding-small"><strong>Warning: This is a paid resource.</strong> If you get really distracted, and you want to build a good looking portfolio, I would recommend using Udacity. I used Udacity, and I learned a lot, plus it helped me build my portfolio and focus. A lot of people do not like Udacity, because of their price point. I can definitely see their point. But it helped me build a portfolio, and that portfolio helped me land a job. Your results may vary.</p>
		
		<p class="padding-small">I hope you enjoyed reading this, and I hope this helped you. Getting focused is really difficult in programming, but finding great resources will help with that, and I think this list can take you a long way.</p>
